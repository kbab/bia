Code for Bioimage Archive Interview task

This repo contains a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) app using the [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for API calls as specified in the Bioimage Archive Interview task. Please note that as it is an informal demo, the app runs in debug mode and is allowed to be hosted on any server.

Until 22/06/2021 there will be a working version of the app online which can be accessed by:
* List of accession IDs - http://94.156.201.94:8000/api/v1/images
* Metadata by accession ID - http://94.156.201.94:8000/api/v1/BIA-02/metadata
* Imagesize by accession ID - http://94.156.201.94:8000/api/v1/BIA-03/imagesize
